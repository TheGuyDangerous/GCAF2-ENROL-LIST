## Official Website and Syllabus for the Program

While you can find all the active games and trivia quests on the [Google Cloud Arcade website](https://go.qwiklabs.com/arcade) directly, we are maintaining a copy of the same here so that it becomes easier for you to find badges and complete them so that you can earn "Arcade Points". (See points system for more details)

**Recommended - Its better to complete the games and trivia first since they have a deadline in a given month. Complete as many skill badges as you can later to earn more "Arcade Points".**
